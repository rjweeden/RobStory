Two days ago my puppy lost her first teeth. Yesterday she lost two more. Piper still bites a lot.

The next day, Piper lost the rest of her teeth. Piper looked really weird without any teeth. All of the other dogs made fun of her.

But when Piper got her adult teeth, they were the shiniest teeth of all. All the other dogs were jealous. And Piper nipped them all.

Piper wanted every bit of respect back from the previous encounter, so she walked around with her teeth out showing every dog walking by. She bit whoever did not flatter.

Then all the dogs respected her, as they whined out with fear. Piper please no more biting, we don't want to shed any more tears.

The end.
