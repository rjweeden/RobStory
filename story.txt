Two days ago my puppy lost her first teeth. Yesterday she lost two more. Piper still bites a lot.

The next day, Piper lost the rest of her teeth. Piper looked really weird without any teeth. All of the other dogs made fun of her.

But when Piper got her adult teeth, they were the shiniest teeth of all. All the other dogs were jealous. And Piper nipped them all.
